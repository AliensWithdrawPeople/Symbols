Symbols is  set of haskell modules that implement some computer algebra ideas. 


Before you start working on Symbols or working with Symbols (highly unrecommended)
you should know some points:

1) Symbols is educational pet project. It means, author is amateur. So there are a lot of mistakes, 
bad architectural decision etc. Don't be too cruel with me.

2) Symbols is open-source project. It means, you are welcome to participate. 

Rest will be added in future.
